## When we have the will, we have the future

Hi, I'm **José** 

I'm a Java Backend Developer who believes that building the future requires mastering the right tools. For me, "tools" aren't just technologies, they are the architectures, methodologies, and best practices that transform complex challenges into reliable and scalable software.

My goal is to apply my toolkit to build systems that are not just functional, but future-proof.

### My Toolkit

Here are the primary tools I use to build and test software solutions.

*   **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA / Hibernate, Maven
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL
*   **DevOps & Tools:** Docker, Docker Compose, Git, Flyway
*   **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito

### Let's Build the Future Together

I am looking for an internship where I can apply my tools and passion to a team that is building meaningful software. If you're looking for a developer who is serious about their craft, let's connect.
